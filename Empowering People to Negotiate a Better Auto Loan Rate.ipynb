    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A major concern for lenders is being left out of the conversation when a potential borrower talks to an autodealer. The problem is knowing when a person is actually at a car dealership.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the car-dealers are offering the person who is buying a loan a loan and many insurance policies that are significantly marked-up. By enabling financial instutitions to understand when someone is at a car dealership, they are able to help reduce the borrowers total cost of ownership a lot and gives them a better negotiating position with the dealer.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a prototype, Foursquare location data will be used for the Chicago area. Using this information with some coordinate data, we will calculate the distance from the dealership and create a flag whether or not we believe this individual is at a car dealership.\n",
